## Details of Main Features

#### Log In Required

![Crm Landing Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-landing-page.png "Crm Landing Page")
![Crm Log in Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-login.png "Crm Log in Page")

In order to use the app you need to be an authenticated user, otherwise you will only see the landing page. I didn't use any packages, I made the authentication from scratch.

#### Edit Account

![Crm Edit Account Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-edit-account.png "Crm Edit Account Page")
Users have the ability to edit their accounts.


#### Contacts

![Crm Add Contact Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-new-contact.png "Crm Add Contact Page")

Logged in users can create contacts and groups to associate the contacts so they can filter by groups. When creating a new contact users have the ability to create groups and the drop down where you can associate the contact to a group will be automatically updated thanks to the use of [Drab](https://github.com/grych/drab "Drab") for realtime updates. Also you users can search for contacts.


#### Notes

![Crm View Contact Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-view-contact.png "Crm View Contact Page")

When viewing a contact users can add notes associated to that contact, delete and edit notes all done with [Drab](https://github.com/grych/drab "Drab") for realtime updates.


#### Pagination

Pagination for contacts and notes are done with the [Kerosene](https://github.com/elixirdrops/kerosene "Kerosene") package.


#### My groups

![Crm My Groups Page](/crm-readme-img/crm-manage-groups.png "Crm My Groups Page")

Users can delete groups.


#### Uploads

Users can upload avatar for contacts, it's done with the packages [Arc](https://github.com/stavro/arc "Arc"), [Arc.Ecto](https://github.com/stavro/arc_ecto "Arc Ecto").

Note: Uploads won't work in heroku because I'm using local storage.
